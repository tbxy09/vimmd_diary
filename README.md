## vimmd_diary

this project baseline is [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki)

## update of mine:

the main goal is to change the extension to *markdown extension* from the origin
wiki extension ,*ext wiki -> ext md* I want to sync the diary to my blog site

#### breakdown

- a local vars to store *key properties* of vimwiki, and one of them is extension

- some hard conversion in origin code when file detect not a *wiki* type, will do
  a hard conversion
